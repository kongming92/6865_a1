1. Took around 4 hours
2. I believe everything is working fine.
3. Briefly discussed how to do some things in numpy with Ryan Lacey
4. Most difficult part was getting Numpy to do what I wanted. The concepts
seemed straightforward; it was just difficult to implement it without knowing
the proper syntax.
5. Creation of the spanish castle illusion successfully

The file testCastle.py tests the creation of the spanish castle illusion 
since it isn't tested by the a1Requirements script. It produces the 
two images included (C.png and L.png)

The file testHist prints the histogram given in the homework writeup. It calls
printHisto(im, 10, 15) which is much more manageable than the histogram 
printed in the a1Requirements script.
